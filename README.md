VARY is and android application which can be used within a educational institute like college or university. Students or teachers can use it to create a petition and upload it, petition can be any problem that they are facing in their institute and want to change it. After uploading petition if your fellow students or other teacher supports you then they sign your petition. Once your petition reaches a critical level of signature for eg 500 signature then it is presented to the decision maker you have chosen. A decision maker is the person who can bring change you want to see.
